              The visualization shown in the webpage above cogently illustrates
              the source of the power plants, whose energy we consume everyday,
              in the U.S.

              One can easily find that each region/state in the country has a
              certain characteristics in its primary source of the power. For
              example, coal-based power is widely used in east side of the
              country, where there are a lot of mining sites of the resource
              beside the mountains. On the other hand, solar power plant is a
              popular plant type in the southwest region, in which people can
              except more shiny days in a year than any of other regions. The
              flat land and stable weather is a good condition for wind-based
              power so that there are many wind power plants in the plain area.
