            The visualization shown in the webpage above clearly illustrates the
            source of the power plants in the U.S. Each point in the plot
            displays the location of a power plant. Its size represents the
            output of the plant and the color stands for the source of the
            power.
          </p>
          <p>
            One can easily find that each region/state in the country has a
            certain characteristics in its primary source of the power. For
            example, coal-based power is widely used in east side of the
            country, where there are a lot of mining sites of the resource
            beside the mountains. On the other hand, solar power plant is a
            popular plant type in the southwest region, in which people can
            except more shiny days in a year than any of other regions. The flat
            land and stable weather is a good condition for wind-based power so
            that there are many wind power plants in the plain area. Also, users
            may find which part of the country has higher output of electricity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, the webpage offers an interactive bar plot, with which
            users can explore the component of the power in each state. Users
            may click the type of the source to rearrange the bar plot and hover
            the section of the plot to display the share of the source in the
            state. This helps them further understand the primary source of the
            energy they use everyday in various locations of the country.

            In short, this set of the visualizations offers a good user
            experience. It has a clear motivation of the visualization (i.e., to
            display the distribution of various power plants), appropriate
            selection of size/color of each point and legend placement, and
            additional feature that enables users to further investigate the
            details of the topic. It might be further better visualization if it
            could let users select the resource type or output power to
            dynamically change the plot on the map.

            We report this as an extra visualization as it is not described in
            English. This visualization presented by a big-data analysis team in
            Yahoo! JAPAN illustrates the required travel time from Tokyo station
            to any location in Japan by public transit. They have completed this
            project with the big data provided by their navigation app. The
            details will be found in
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvT8-LKQUJU">this video</a
            >. The color in the visualization represents the travel time from
            Tokyo station (red: short - green: long). As it targets only the
            public transit, some locations could not be reached out.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this visualization, one can notice that the high speed rail
            network clearly contributes to shorten the travel time when it is
            available. The following image is a capture from the video. It
            indicates that traveling from Tokyo to Nagoya, which is
            approximately 220 miles away, is as quick as travelling to Kofu,
            which is less than 80 miles from Tokyo. Consequently, the map has
            some "veins" by the high speed rails from Tokyo station as shown in
            the first image.
          </p>

            Additionally, the research team has tried to simulate the same plot
            after the completion of the maglev line that will be available in
            2040. The video is available
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QayKhIgPqBk">here</a>. The
            top-left plot in the image above is the visualization before the
            maglev, and the bottom-right one is after the maglev. Clearly, the
            new line not only extends the furthest places where people can
            travel from Tokyo within 3 hours, but also introduce new locations
            which will acquire an access to a high-speed transit system.
          </p>

            Although it is a static visualization and users cannot manipulate
            the plot interactively, this work is an exemplar of a
            geolocation-based big data. With this video, the general public can
            easily understand the power of the current public transit system and
            the benefits of the brand new transportation technology.
